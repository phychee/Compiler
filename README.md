# Compiler
This is a simple compiler for Python to learn more about building compilers and for practicing my C/C++ skills. Hope you like it :)

# Compiler Parts and their Implementation:

## Lexer:
Parses the code and breaks it down into tokens. The first version of the Lexxer will tokenize simple Python operations with numbers like add, subtract, multiply, divide, etc..

## Parser:

## Intermediate Code Generator:

## Code Optimizer: 

## Code Generator: 

Will continue adding to the project as the compiler grows.
