# Interpreter
This is a simple interpreter for Python to learn more about building compilers and for practicing my C/C++ skills. Hope you like it :)

# Parts and their Implementation:

## Lexer:
Parses the code and breaks it down into tokens. The first version of the Lexxer will tokenize simple Python operations with numbers like add, subtract, multiply, divide, etc..

## Parser: 

Will continue adding to the project as the interpreter grows.
